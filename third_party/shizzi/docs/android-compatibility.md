# Android compatibility

Shizzi routes a phone's Wi-Fi hotspot traffic through a tunnel the app controls,
instead of letting it go straight out over the phone's own internet connection.
It creates a TUN interface, registers it with Android as a *test network*, and
gets the tethering stack to use that network as the hotspot's upstream. All of
this needs privileges an ordinary app does not have, which the app obtains
through [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/).

**`minSdk = 30`.** Capability 3 is what decides whether a device can tether,
and on API 30-32 it depends on the installed tethering module rather than the
API level. Those devices install the app and are offered the Android 12
tethering APEX, which carries the mechanism; a device that declines it, or whose
module still lacks the call after installing, is told so instead of tethering.
API 33 and up have it outright. Nothing below 30 can work -- API 29 cannot start
a hotspot at all.

## What the platform has to provide

Three separate capabilities, with three different floors:

1. **Start the hotspot** — `TetheringManager.startTethering`, falling back to
   `WifiManager.startTetheredHotspot`. From API 30.
2. **Create a test network** — build the TUN and register it via
   `TestNetworkManager`. From API 29.
3. **Route hotspot traffic through it** — `setPreferTestNetworks` raises a flag,
   and `UpstreamNetworkMonitor` has to check it. From API 32 or 33, depending on
   the tethering module.

Capability 3 decides support. Capability 2 has the lowest floor, so checking
whether a release "supports test networks" returns yes well below the real
floor and answers nothing.

## Support by release

| API | Release | Start hotspot | Test network | Prefer test network | Net |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 29 | Android 10 | **no** | yes | no | no |
| 30 | Android 11 | yes | yes | *module-dependent* | with module |
| 31 | Android 12 | yes | yes | *module-dependent* | with module |
| 32 | Android 12L | yes | yes | *module-dependent* | with module |
| 33 | Android 13 | yes | yes | yes | **yes** |
| 36 | Android 16 | yes | yes | yes | yes (known-good) |

### API 29

`TetheringManager` does not exist, and `startTetheredHotspot` arrives at API 30.
API 29 cannot start a hotspot, so capability 3 does not matter.

Capability 2 is fully present, verified against `android10-release`:

| API | On Android 10 (29)? |
| --- | --- |
| `TestNetworkManager` (via `getSystemService("test_network")`) | present |
| `createTunInterface(LinkAddress[])` | present (array overload, which `invokeArrayOverload` probes) |
| `setupTestNetwork(String, IBinder)` | present |
| `teardownTestNetwork(Network)` | present |
| `TestNetworkInterface.getFileDescriptor()` / `getInterfaceName()` | present |
| `LinkAddress(InetAddress, int)` | present (package-private, so reached reflectively) |
| `NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_TEST` | present, `= 7` (matches `TRANSPORT_TEST_AOSP_FALLBACK`) |
| `WifiManager.startTetheredHotspot` | **absent** — arrives at API 30 |

### API 30 and 31

The hotspot starts and the TUN registers, but `setPreferTestNetworks` does not
exist, so nothing selects the TUN. Probed at shell UID on both: 
`NoSuchMethodException`. On 31 the tethering jar contains no symbol matching
`TestNetwork`, so there is no renamed method or alternate overload to find.

### API 32

The 12L source tag (`android-12.1.0_r10`) does not have the mechanism. The
emulator image does:

- `framework-tethering.jar` contains `setPreferTestNetworks` and
  `TRANSACTION_setPreferTestNetworks`
- `TetheringGoogle.apk`, which reads the flag, contains it too
- Called at shell UID it returns normally, and the server logs
  `TetheringManager: setPreferTestNetworks caller: android` with no denial

Tethering ships as an updatable Mainline APEX, so the API level does not
determine the module version. An API 32 device that has taken module updates may
have this; one that has not, will not.

Only the call was verified, not tethering: emulators have no SoftAP, so no
hotspot was started and no traffic carried, and whether `UpstreamNetworkMonitor`
selects the TUN on 32 is untested. This is why 30-32 are reached through the
module install rather than claimed as supported -- the app probes the device it
is actually on and reports what it finds.

### API 33 and up

Both halves are present from 33 and survive to current releases. Checked at 33
(`android-13.0.0_r43`) and 36 (`android-16.0.0_r4`); 34 and 35 were not checked
separately. The app is known to work on an Android 16 device.

A 33+ device is not guaranteed to work. The app reaches `TestNetworkManager` and
`TetheringManager` by reflection into `@hide` and `@TestApi` surfaces, which
vendors can trim. Run `ProbeRunner.kt` to check a specific handset.

## The tethering module install

Tethering ships as an updatable Mainline APEX, so on 30-32 the API level does
not determine whether `setPreferTestNetworks` is present -- the installed module
version does. The repo carries `apex/tethering-311314000.apex`, the Android 12
tethering module that contains the call.

When the compatibility check finds a test network but no preference call on a
30-32 device, the app offers that module. It downloads the APEX pinned by commit
SHA and SHA-256, stages it through the Shizuku shell with
`pm install --apex --staged`, and the device reboots to apply it. A staged APEX
install only takes effect on reboot, so the app says so rather than reporting
success against a module that is not live yet.

This is offered, not assumed to work. Vendors can trim the surfaces the app
reflects into, and the emulator verification behind the module covered the call
rather than a carried hotspot. After the reboot the check runs again and answers
from the device rather than from the API level.

## What the shell UID buys

Shizuku runs as shell (UID 2000), which holds the permissions gating these APIs
(`granted=true`, checked on 30, 32 and 33):

| Permission | Held by shell |
| --- | --- |
| `TETHER_PRIVILEGED` | yes |
| `MANAGE_TEST_NETWORKS` | yes |
| `NETWORK_SETTINGS` | yes |
| `NETWORK_STACK` | **no** |

`setPreferTestNetworks` is gated on `TETHER_PRIVILEGED`, not `NETWORK_SETTINGS`
as its `@hide` annotation says. An app without it is refused with
`SecurityException: No android.permission.TETHER_PRIVILEGED or
android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS permission`.

Shell cannot configure routing directly. On 30, 31, 32 and 33 alike:

- `ip rule add`, `ip route add` → `Cannot talk to rtnetlink: Permission denied`.
  Shell is in `inet` and `net_bw_stats`, not `net_admin`.
- `iptables` → `Permission denied (you must be root)`
- `netd` → `avc: denied { find } ... tcontext=u:object_r:netd_service:s0`.
  SELinux blocks the service lookup before any permission check.

This is why [VPNHotspot](https://github.com/mygod/vpnhotspot), which configures
tethering routes by hand, needs root. It also rules out doing the routing
manually as a way to support older releases. These denials apply on 33 as well,
where the app works, so they are not what separates releases.

## Probing correctly

Two conditions, or the probe reports false negatives:

1. Lift the hidden-API blocklist —
   `settings put global hidden_api_policy 1`
2. Run at shell UID via `app_process`, not as an app

Run as an ordinary app, the probe reports `NoSuchMethodException` on every
release including 33, where the app works.

Source reading has its own blind spot: it cannot see which Mainline module a
device has. Reading `android-12.1.0_r10` says what shipped with 12L, not what is
installed now.

## What would change the answer for 30 and 31

Only a different mechanism for winning upstream selection:

- Another hidden switch biasing selection. The source trace argues against one —
  every return path out of the selection method is accounted for.
- Giving the TUN a shape the ordinary rules accept, which needs
  `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET` on a network `TestNetworkService` will not grant it.
- Forwarding at a lower layer instead, which is a different product and needs
  root.
