# Automation

Shizzi can be started and stopped by other apps — Tasker, MacroDroid, or
anything else that can send an intent.

To start and stop it yourself without opening the app, add the quick settings
tile to your notification shade instead.

## Enabling

Off by default. Turn it on in **Settings › Advanced › Automation**.

A token is generated when you turn automation on, and every command must
carry it. The token card copies and regenerates it, and **Setup** lists every
value an automation app needs, per action. Commands without a matching token are refused, so an app that does
not know the token cannot control tethering.

## Background starts

Android 12 and up block an app in the background from starting a foreground
service, which is what an intent-triggered session needs. Exemption from
battery optimization is the documented way out of that restriction, and only
the user can grant it.

Grant **Background activity** in **Settings › Permissions**, or during
onboarding. Until you do, commands are accepted but no session starts, and the
log says so.

## Actions

Sent to `dev.shizzi/.AutomationReceiver` as a broadcast.

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `dev.shizzi.action.START` | Start a session |
| `dev.shizzi.action.STOP` | Stop the session |
| `dev.shizzi.action.TOGGLE` | Stop if running, otherwise start |
| `dev.shizzi.action.QUERY_STATUS` | Report state without changing it |

Pass the token as the string extra `token`.

## Result

Every command answers with a `dev.shizzi.action.SESSION_RESULT` broadcast.
Because a start runs through Shizuku binding, interface setup, and upstream
verification, this can arrive some seconds after the request — catch it rather
than assuming the command took effect.

The result is broadcast without a target package, so any app registered for
that action can read it, including the session status, interface name, client
count, and traffic counters. The token is never included. Commands themselves
still need the token, so a listening app can observe a session but cannot
start or stop one.

| Extra | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | string | The command being answered |
| `accepted` | boolean | Whether the command passed the gate |
| `refusal` | string | Why it was refused, when `accepted` is false |
| `status` | string | `READY`, `LOADING`, `CONNECTED`, or `ERROR` |
| `isActive` | boolean | Whether tethering is up |
| `detail` | string | Human-readable state |
| `interface` | string | Upstream interface name |
| `error` | string | Failure reason, when one applies |
| `clientCount` | int | Connected devices |
| `bytesUp` / `bytesDown` | long | Session traffic |

A refused command reports `accepted=false` and changes nothing.

## Tasker

Add a **System › Send Intent** action:

- Action: `dev.shizzi.action.TOGGLE`
- Package: `dev.shizzi`
- Class: `dev.shizzi.AutomationReceiver`
- Target: `Broadcast Receiver`
- Extra: `token:your-token`

To react to the result, add an **Event › System › Intent Received** profile
with the action `dev.shizzi.action.SESSION_RESULT`. The extras above arrive as
variables, so `%isActive` tells you whether tethering came up.

## MacroDroid

Use a **Send Intent** action with target `Broadcast`, the same action and
class, and add `token` as a string extra. Catch the result with an
**Intent Received** trigger on `dev.shizzi.action.SESSION_RESULT`.

## adb

Useful for checking a setup:

```
adb shell am broadcast -a dev.shizzi.action.QUERY_STATUS \
  -n dev.shizzi/.AutomationReceiver --es token your-token
```
